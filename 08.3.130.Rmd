# 8.3.130 one sample t-test{-}

The following data represent the concentration of organic carbon​ (mg/L) collected from organic soil. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the mean concentration of dissolved organic carbon collected from organic soil.​ (Note: $\bar x$ = 16.56 mg/L and s = 8.3 mg/L)

**Construct a 99​% confidence interval for the mean concentration of dissolved organic carbon collected from organic soil.**

Since the question gives t-distribution table we will use t-test.

First, we need to get the data from Excel. (The approach below gets the data mannually)
```{r}
data <- c(14.00,  8.81, 30.91, 19.80, 29.80,  7.40, 14.86, 14.86, 27.10, 20.46, 14.00,  8.09, 16.51, 14.90, 15.35,  5.30,  7.40, 33.67,  9.72, 18.30)
```
<hr />
To get 99% confidence interval, we run
```{r}
t.test(data, conf.level = .99)
```
<hr />
To get the data in 2 decimal places, we run 
```{r}
print(t.test(data, conf.level = .99), 4)
```
As you can see 99% confidence interval is from 11.25, 21.87
