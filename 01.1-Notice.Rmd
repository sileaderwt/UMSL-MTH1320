<hr/>
There are two main reasons that this document does not use third party package.

* We do not know which formulas they use behind the scene and sometimes it is hard to retrieve data.

* We could avoid technical difficulties.

* We do not have to keep up to date every time that third party changes their package. 

* The document uses formulas from the book and these formulas have a long history with statistic which means they are consistent over time. We could write our third party package based on these formulas. 

<hr/>

**The way that R round number is slightly differen than the book.**
```{r}
round(1.5, 0)
round(.15,1)
```
<hr/>
To have a better understanding about how round() works, we could read the instruction from help()
```{r}
help(round)
```
